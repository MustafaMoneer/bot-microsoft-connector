# Start coding your bot: Recast.AI + Microsoft Bot Connector

This Starter Kit will help you start coding a bot connected to Microsoft Bot connector with [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai).

## Requirements

* Create an account on [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai)
* Create an account on [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com)
* Create accounts on messaging applications available on Microsoft Bot Platform (Slack, Messenger, Kik...)

## Get your Recast.AI bot token

* Log in to your [Recast.AI](https://recast.ai/) account
* Create your Bot
* Create intents and fill them with some expressions
* Build your conversation flow on bot builder in the 'Build' tab
* In the tab menu, click on the the little screw
* Here is the `request access token` you will need to configure your bot!

## Get your Microsoft secret

* Create an account on [Microsoft Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/)
* Create a new bot and follow the procedure. The endpoint url you have to put will be explained later.
* Get your app password and app ID that will be useful later

* Follow the different steps for every channel you want to add.

## Put your local server online with Ngrok

Whenever the bot receives a message on Microsoft Bot Platform, it will be sent to the server running on the endpoint url specified on Microsoft Bot Platform.
Problem: the server will be running locally (no url) Thatâ€™s why you will use ngrok which make a local server run online.

* Download [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) and put it at the root of your folder
* run it with `./ngrok http 8080`
* Copy and paste the secured url (https) on the endpoint field of your bot in Microsoft Bot Framework

## Launch the bot

#### Complete the config.js file

* Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RecastAI/bot-microsoft-connector.git
```

* Fill the config.js with your tokens

```javascript
const config =
{
	recast: {
		token: 'RECAST TOKEN',
		language: 'en',
	},
	microsoft: {
		appId: 'MICROSOFT APP ID',
		appPassword: 'MICROSOFT APP PASSWORD',
	},
	port: 8080,
}
```

#### Run

* install the dependencies

```
cd bot-microsoft-connector
```
```
npm install
```

* run your bot

```
npm run start
```

## Go further

Here is the heart of your bot. The following function is called every time your bot receives a message.
'res' is full of precious information:

* use **res.memory('notion')** to access a notion you just got in the input like a email address, a datetime etc...
* use **res.action** to get the current action according to your bot builder flow
* in **action**, you can find a done boolean to know if this action is complete according to the requirements (ex: booking need to signin, signin needs a login)
* use **res.reply()** to get the reply you've set for this action
* use **res.replies** to get an array containing the reply set for the action && the following one if the next action is complete
* use **res.nextActions** to get an array of all the following actions

For more information, please read the [SDK NodeJS documentation](https://github.com/RecastAI/SDK-NodeJS)

```javascript
bot.dialog('/', (session) => {
  const text = session.message.text

  // CALL TO RECAST.AI: session.message.address.conversation.id contains a unique ID of your conversation with the channel used
  // The conversationToken is what lets Recast.AI identify your conversation.
  // As session.message.address.conversation.id is what identifies your conversation with the channel used, you can use it as conversationToken.

  recastClient.textConverse(text, { conversationToken: session.message.address.conversation.id })
  .then((res) => {
    const replies = res.replies
    const action = res.action

    if (!replies.length) {
      session.send('I didn\'t understand... Sorry :(')
      return
    }

    if (action && action.done) {
      // Use external services: use res.memory('notion') if you got a notion from this action
    }

    replies.forEach(reply => session.send(reply))
  })
  .catch(() => {
    session.send('I need some sleep right now... Talk to me later!')
  })
})
```
